                <h2>The Limitations of Traditional Weather Forecasts</h2>
                <p>General weather forecasts, often provided for a city or region, may not accurately reflect the specific conditions on your farm. Microclimates can exist within relatively short distances, leading to variations in temperature, rainfall, wind, and other factors. Relying on generalized forecasts can result in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Poor timing of planting, fertilization, and pesticide applications.</li>
                    <li>Inefficient irrigation practices.</li>
                    <li>Increased risk of crop damage due to unexpected weather events.</li>
                    <li>Suboptimal harvesting schedules.</li>
