                  <h2>The Challenges of Traditional Yield Estimation</h2>
                  <p>Traditionally, yield estimation has relied on manual sampling, historical data, or even educated guesses. These methods can be inaccurate, unreliable, and often don't provide timely information. Some of the limitations include:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                          <h3>Inaccurate Estimates</h3>
                          <p>Manual sampling can be prone to errors and may not represent the entire field accurately.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <h3>Delayed Information</h3>
                          <p>Traditional methods often provide yield estimates late in the growing season, limiting their usefulness for planning.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <h3>Lack of Spatial Detail</h3>
                          <p>Manual methods typically don't provide information about yield variations within a field.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <h3>Subjectivity</h3>
                          <p>Estimates based on experience or "gut feeling" can be highly subjective and unreliable.</p>
                      </li>
